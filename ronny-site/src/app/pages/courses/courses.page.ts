       and system security by studying attacks on computer systems, network, and the Web as well as detection and prevention. 
       
       Work is completed in Unix/Linux environments and in Microsoft Windows environment. Students will need to setup a virtual private infrastructure to perform multiple tasks; additionally unlimited AWS cloud resources 
       will be available for them. The course emphasizes "learning by doing" and has a 90% hands on and 10% theory approach. Much of this information consists of skills 
       and abilities that employers want and expect in the real world of IT in a small to medium size organization.`,
